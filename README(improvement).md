# PDF Highlighting Optimization

## Overview
This update optimizes the PDF highlighting functionality in the PDFRAG system to address fragmented highlights and improve overall performance.

## Key Changes

### Single Paragraph Highlighting
- Modified the `highlight_text_in_pdf` method to identify and highlight only one paragraph that most accurately matches the retrieved content
- Eliminated the multi-rectangle highlighting approach that caused fragmentation issues

### Performance Improvements
- Implemented a two-pass algorithm:
  1. First pass: Scan document to find the best matching text block
  2. Second pass: Apply highlight only to the specific location
- Reduced computational complexity by eliminating repetitive vector calculations

### Enhanced Matching
- Leveraged `fuzz.ratio()` from RapidFuzz for more accurate text similarity scoring
- Added configurable threshold (default: 60%) to ensure only high-quality matches are highlighted

## Implementation
The new implementation replaces the previous complex paragraph construction logic with a streamlined approach that:
- Processes each text block individually
- Uses fuzzy string matching for better text comparison
- Creates a single coherent highlight for the user

## Benefits
- Cleaner, more focused document highlights
- Improved processing efficiency
- More accurate identification of relevant content
- Better user experience with non-fragmented highlights

## Usage
The API remains unchanged - simply update the `highlight_text_in_pdf` method with the new implementation. The function continues to return highlight metadata in the same format for consistent integration with the rest of the system.
